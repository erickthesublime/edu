    • Problem Research - Three Paragraphs averaging 178 Words.
    • Oak Grove Home Renewable Energy Considerations Five Paragraphs averaging 80 words.
    • Two biographies - Averaging 350 Words including a Biography AND Career Mathemati- cal Model sections. Mathematical Models used by the person who the biography was about!
    • Mathematical Model - 480 words, PVWatt Calculator tool created by the government was used.
    • Total cost of the Solar Panel Installation 5 paragraphs averaging 83 words Erick’s Personal Thoughts: I literally installed solar panels in Kentucky! Ask me for pictures! My boss used some form of google maps to extract the area for the roof sizes of his customers. I wonder if AI could do this automatically! That is a product! Back to annotating: They used the equation P(kWh) = E(kWh)/t(h).

    where P was the total kW and E was the average energy use and t is daily average hours of sun. They plugged this into the government calculator mentioned before.
    Thesis Defense 11 paragraphs averaging 75 words.
    Conclusion 2 paragraphs averaging 141 words.

    This thesis extended well beyond expectations in the following ways: Possible Ex- tensions include but are not limited to, creativity, teamwork, organization is excep- tional. 5 points

II. Problem Research

> Data presented is used in a meaningful way to support the conclusion given in this thesis. The work includes well-labeled tables, graphs, and figures with titles that sup- port the work and lead to analysis and interpretation toward the solution. 10 points

- Thesis: exploring and advocating for the feasibility and favorability of installing a solar photovoltaic (PV) system as the primary source of renewable energy for a specific home in Oak Grove, Kentucky.

- Data presented is used in a meaningful way to support the conclusion:
1. Solar Insolation Data:
    Section: Problem Research
    Context: This section discusses the solar potential in Christian County, mentioning that the location receives about 4.4 peak hours of sun insolation daily. This data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) substantiates the feasibility of solar power in this specific geographic area.
2. Local Energy Consumption Patterns:
    Section: Oak Grove Home Renewable Energy Considerations
    Context: Detailed energy usage statistics from Pennyrile Electric are provided, including daily, monthly, and annual consumption figures. These figures are essential for sizing the solar system appropriately to meet the home's energy needs.
3. Cost Analysis and Incentives:
    Section: Thesis Defense & Cost-Benefit Analysis
    Context: Financial data, including the cost of installing a solar system and the savings from tax incentives like the ITC, are discussed. A detailed cost-benefit analysis is presented in a table format, showing the long-term financial benefits and the payback period.
4. Potential Energy Production:
    Section: Use of Mathematical Models in Research/Publications
    Context: Calculations from the PVWatts Calculator are used to estimate potential electricity production from the proposed solar system. This section outlines how much energy the system can generate, which is crucial for proving that the system can provide adequate power.


> The work includes well-labeled tables, graphs, and figures with titles that sup- port the work and lead to analysis and interpretation toward the solution:
1. Cost-Benefit Analysis Tables:
    Tables 1 and 2: These tables are presented in the "Thesis Defense" section and specifically in the "Cost-Benefit Analysis" subsection. Table 1 shows the 2018 Pennyrile Electricity Bill Totals and kWh Totals, providing a breakdown of the home's energy consumption and costs. Table 2 presents a detailed cost-benefit analysis over a 40-year period, showing the projected costs of the solar system, the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), avoided future electric costs, annual cash flow, NPV of annual cash flow, and cumulative NPV.
    Purpose and Utility: These tables are essential for demonstrating the financial viability of the solar system. They allow the reader to clearly see the initial costs, long-term benefits, and the payback period, effectively supporting the thesis that a solar system is a beneficial investment.
2. Mathematical Model Outputs:
    PVWatts Calculator Outputs: While specific graphs are not detailed in the text provided, the discussion indicates that outputs from the PVWatts Calculator would typically include estimations of monthly and annual electricity production. These would logically be presented in graphical form to illustrate potential energy production throughout the year.
    Purpose and Utility: If included, these graphs would visually demonstrate how the solar system meets the home’s energy needs across different seasons, reinforcing the argument for solar power's adequacy and reliability.
3. Environmental Impact Visuals:
    Hypothetical Figures: Discussion of environmental impacts, such as reductions in CO2 emissions, would benefit from visual aids like graphs or charts comparing emissions from coal and natural gas versus solar energy. These would visually represent the environmental benefits discussed.
    Purpose and Utility: These figures would support the environmental arguments for choosing solar energy by providing a clear visual comparison of the impact of different energy sources on public health and environmental quality.
